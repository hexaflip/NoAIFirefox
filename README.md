# No AI on Google
I am not sure what to call this so I am leaving the title with as little ambiguity as possible. This extension tries its best to limit exposure to content generated by Large Language Models on Firefox based browsers for the search engine known as Google. I know it's hypocritcal to be using a hardened browser but still use Google, but it is the most used for a reason. So far this extension has been used on Librewolf. This can be used to help with research and other activities that need clear answers with no room for hallucinations or errors.
